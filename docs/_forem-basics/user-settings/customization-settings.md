# Customization Settings

These are options for users to modify their experience on your Forem. These settings override any defaults that you may set.

## Appearance
Users can choose a **Site Theme**, **Base Reading Font**, and decide for themselves if the **Site Nav Bar** remains at the top of their display when they scroll or scrolls up with the rest of the page layout.

## Writing
### Editor Version
Select either Basic markdown editor or Rich + markdown editor. Any drafts started before switching editors will continue to use the version of the editor they were started with. E.g. if a user begins a draft in Basic before switching to Rich, they will still see the Basic editor when they reopen that draft for editing. All new drafts will use the new editor version, in this case, Rich + markdown.

## Content
All articles on a Forem can be rated 1-5 for difficulty by the author or moderators. Selecting a difficulty level in the User Settings helps customize the user’s feed.

## Sponsors
Forem sponsors can help sustain the platform, so this option is worded to discourage opt-out. Nonetheless, users have the choice of whether or not they want to view sponsor ads.

## Announcements
Announcements allow you to share important information, like updates and events, in the form of banners that appear at the top of the page. These are enabled by default, so you can easily communicate with all users, but can be disabled for clutter-free browsing.
