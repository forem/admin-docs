# Profile Settings

If a user is a member of multiple Forems, they can have entirely different settings for each one. As an Admin, you may experience users who are unaccustomed to this, so it's handy for you to know what falls under their Settings compared to your Forem Admin configuration.

## User
Contains the required information for every user. 
All users must have a profile image. If a user doesn’t upload a profile image, they will be automatically assigned a Gravatar.

## Basic
Optional user information.

## Branding
Users can make changes to the appearance of their profile.

## Coding
This is a DEV legacy section that may disappear from future versions of Forem.

## Work
Another DEV legacy section that has broader application.
