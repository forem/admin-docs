### Logo PNG

Square image used to represent the website by crawlers \(i.e. larger alternative to favicon in some places\) and in the Forem ecosystem, and anywhere where the site's logo should be represented by a **square** PNG. It represents the primary logo everywhere except the nav area, because nav expects more custom dimensions.

### Logo SVG

This is the logo that appears on the nav bar and footer of the site. Please upload in SVG format, with a max height of 50px.
