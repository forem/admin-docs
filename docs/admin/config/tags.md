# Tags

### Sidebar Tags

Determines which tags are pinned to the homepage righthand sidebar. Posts that are associated with a pinned tag will render below the tag, on the sidebar. High-quality posts will be rendered below the tag only if they are _available_. If _no_ tags are added to this field, then _no_ tags will show in the homepage sidebar.

To use this feature, please enter **valid** tags that are **comma-separated**. For example: `tag1,tag2,tag3,tag4`

Please note:

* If you enter a tag that has no associated posts, then your Forem will contain an _empty_ tag \(with no posts rendering below it\) on the sidebar. We recommend only **using tags that have published posts** associated with that tag in the sidebar.
* Please be sure to **check the** **quality of the posts** associated with a tag before pinning it. We will show high-quality posts if they are available, and will default to lower-quality posts when nothing else is available.
* Please be mindful when **pinning approved tags to the homepage righthand sidebar**. A post tagged with an approved tag _will_ show up beneath a pinned tag in the homepage's sidebar, regardless of a post's approval \(or lack thereof\).
