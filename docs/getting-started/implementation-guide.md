# Forem Implementation Guide

:::important

We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

:::

This implementation guide is meant to outline a clear path to success for Forem Creators.

We've broken this guide down into 3 stages â€” **Ready**, **Set**, & **Grow**. As you progress through the checklist for each stage, you'll complete the set up process for your Forem, learn the various features available to you and your community, and eventually begin growing your Forem community.

## Ready (Stage 1)

1. Register First User
2. Follow Forem Setup Checklist
   - [Get Started Checklist](https://admin.forem.com/docs/getting-started/forem-setup-checklist#1-set-up-and-configure-your-forem) (Set community name, description, suggested tags, suggested users)
   - [Create a Welcome Thread](https://admin.forem.com/docs/getting-started/forem-setup-checklist#2-create-a-welcome-thread)

   - [Create Pages and Sort Them in the Nav Sidebar](https://admin.forem.com/docs/getting-started/forem-setup-checklist#4-create-pages-and-sort-them-in-the-navigation-sidebar)
