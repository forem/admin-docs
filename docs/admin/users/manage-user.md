# Manage User

### Overview

The manage user pages allows you to take additional actions on the user's account. 

### User Status

The user status indicates the user's role in your Forem. If a user is in good standing, you should see a "Member is in good standing" label. If they have had any offenses, you may see a different label such as "Member is suspended". 

In this section, you can adjust a user's status by:

* Selecting their new role in the dropdown
* Leaving a reason for the role change
* Clicking 'update user status'

### Destructive Actions

Destructive actions are irreversible so use these features with caution.

#### Merge User

If a user accidentally creates two accounts, you can merge their user accounts here. To merge a duplicate account, make sure you are currently on the page of the user you want to KEEP. Below, add the user id of the account to merge information from, and click "Merge User". This will delete the account associated with the user id you added to that field.

#### Banish User

Banishing a user will permanently delete all the user's information \(profile, articles, actions taken on site, etc.\) and change their username to _@spam\_\#\#\#_  to prevent the user from creating another account.. This is irreversible so proceed with caution.

#### Fully Delete User

We encourage users to self-delete their accounts by visiting their settings/account page. If for some reason you need to delete a user account, you can do so here by clicking 'Fully delete user & all activity'. Like the button suggests, this deletes all the users's information \(profile, articles, actions taken on site, etc.\). Unlike the Banish functionality, a user can create a new account after they've been deleted.
