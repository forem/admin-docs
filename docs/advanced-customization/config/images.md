We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

### Logo

The main site logo appears in the site’s navbar (in the top left-hand corner).
The following logo types are accepted: PNG, JPG, and JPEG. Logos should not be more than 3 MB in size and should not be greater than 4096x4096px in dimensions. If your upload attempt is unsuccessful, try resizing the logo and uploading it again.
