# Email Digest

### Periodic email digest

Email digests are automated emails sent to users that highlight suggested posts tailored to their interests. They are separate and distinct from [email newsletters](https://admin.forem.com/docs/advanced-customization/config/newsletter), which are sent and managed from a connected Mailchimp account. **You will need to have [SMTP settings](https://admin.forem.com/docs/advanced-customization/config/smtp-settings) configured for your Forem in order to send email digests.**

Users can opt in or out of these digests at any time from their [Notification Settings](https://admin.forem.com/docs/forem-basics/user-settings/notification-settings) at `/settings/notifications`

You can set the number of days between email digests a user receives.
