# Generated Pages

:::important

We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

:::

**Generated Pages** are pages that are created for your when your Forem is created and spun up for the first time.

:::important

If you're looking for information about a custom page, please visit our [Pages documentation](/docs/forem-basics/pages).

:::

## Overview

Here's a high-level list of the pages you'll receive once your Forem is created.

- `/about`
- `/code-of-conduct`
- `/community-moderation`
- `/contact`
- `/events`
- `/faq`
- `/listings`
- `/pod`
- `/privacy`
- `/readinglist`
- `/sponsors`
- `/tag-moderation`
- `/terms`

## Overriding a Generated Page

Certain pages can be overridden to display a custom page built by yourself or team. A great example of this would be the `/contact` page example.

:::note

Only certain pages are able to be overridden. These pages are:

- `/about`
- `/about-listings`
- `/contact`
- `/community-moderation`
- `/faq`
- `/tag-moderation`

- `/contact` has unique status, in that it's an automatically generated and populated page (which comes with its own [Navigation Link](https://admin.forem.com/docs/advanced-customization/navigation-links) configured) that can be overridden by being [created as a new Page](https://admin.forem.com/docs/forem-basics/pages).
