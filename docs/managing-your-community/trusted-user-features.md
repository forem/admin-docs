# Trusted User Features

:::important

We're in the middle of some fast-moving changes to the Forem Admin experience, so we've paused documentation updates for the time being. You may find that the docs are now outdated in parts. If you have any questions, please visit [forem.dev](https://forem.dev) to request additional support. We thank you for your patience and hope you're liking the changes!

### Overview

Trusted users are users with additional privileges across the platform. They have the ability to:

- Mark a post as high quality
- Mark a post as low quality
- Flag a post to admins
- Set the experience level of a post

### Mod Center

Once a user has the trusted status, they'll have access to the mod center by clicking the shield button on their nav bar.

From the mod center, they can quickly view recently published articles and take the trusted actions highlighted below. Features not highlighted are available to users with higher privileges.

In addition to moderating posts from the mod center, trusted users have access to a quick mod panel on each post by clicking on the badge icon in the lower right.
