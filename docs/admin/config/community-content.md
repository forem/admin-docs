# X - Community Content

### Community Name

Name of the community, in addition to an optional noun that describes your community if desired \(e.g. DEV, DEV Community, DEV Club, etc.\). Your community name will appear in places like the Code of Conduct, page titles, TOS + Privacy Policy, etc.

### Tagline

The community tagline is displayed on sign-up modals and authentication header. For instance, our tagline is "We're a place where coders share, stay up-to-date, and grow their careers." This is different than the description, which is typically a bit longer.

### Community Description

This description is used in meta tags for SEO, onboarding messaging, and the site footer.

### Community Member Label

This is the word used to reference your community members. We use "developers" as our community label.

### Copyright Start Year

This is displayed in the footer of the site. Your copyright start year should be used to mark the year your community started.

### Staff User

In order to update this, you'll need to create a staff account first. The staff account sends automated messages to users, such as in the /welcome thread.

### Experience Low/High

These labels set the low-to-high experience level range for posts. On DEV, we use "newbies" and "experts."
